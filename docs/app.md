Minimalizing your life style doesn't necessarily mean simplifying it. It means less things to do and own, but what is left must be well cared with discipline and mindfulness.

We believe one way to achieve that is having a full control of ownership, managing everything we own, the acquisition of new goods and how cash is employed. No doubt this control can be done using a spreadsheet or even a paper journal, but it must be done.

In our case, we decided to develop a [app][app] to better structure our data, enable notifications and automate some repetitive tasks to reduce our overall effort. These are things a spreadsheet can't do for you. The good news is we have designed it to be used by everybody else interested in minimalism!
